##  Weather

I developed this project using swift with the help of Udemy Course by "Dr. Angela Yu".

## What we will create

By the end of the module, we will have made a beautiful, dark-mode enabled weather app and also we are going to use Application Programming Interface (APIs) to grab live data from internet. We'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually.
